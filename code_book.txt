Code Book to the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project, May 2015

The resulting dataset is a transformation from the "Human Activity Recognition Using 
Smartphones Data Set" (see: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). The original data was downloaded from the URL 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
on Monday May 18 15:41:04 2015.

The following transformations were performed:

The feature names were read from the features.txt file. All non alphanumeric 
characters weredeleted and the remaining characters were changed to lower case 
letters.

The test and the training set were loaded and equiped with the feature names as 
column names. 

Only those measurements that ended on "mean[xyz]" or "std[xyz]" (where [xyz] is one 
of the letters "x", "y" or "z") were left in datasets. Particularly the derived
magnitudes were omitted, because these are no measurements.

Columns for the observed subjects and the performed activities were added to the 
datasets.

The so tranformed test and training datasets were combined to one large dataset X.

The data set X was grouped by subject and activity and only the subject, activity
and the mean of each measurement was stored in the final dataset X_tidy.

Meaning of the Variables in the resuling dataset X_tidy:

Grouping variables
subject             : id of the observed subject (1:30)
activitiy           : factor:   label               value
                                LAYING              1
                                SITTING             2    
                                STANDING            3
                                WALKING             4
